        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

      <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

           <p>Their house is a museum where people come to see â€˜em. They really are a scream the Addams Family. Here's the story of a man named Brady who was busy with three boys of his own. Michael Knight a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. Boy the way Glen Miller played. Songs that made the hit parade. Guys like us we had it made. Those were the days. As long as we live its you and me baby. There ain't nothin' wrong with that. All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls. Today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' - town to town and up and down the dial. Texas tea. Sunny Days sweepin' the clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street.</p>

Never heard the word impossible. This time there's no stopping us. Goodbye gray sky hello blue. There's nothing can hold me when I hold you. Feels so right it cant be wrong.

Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street. One two three four five six seven eight Sclemeel schlemazel hasenfeffer incorporated. And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew. You would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say thank you for being a friend. Doin' it our way. Nothin's gonna turn us back now. Straight ahead and on the track now. We're gonna make our dreams come true. So lets make the most of this beautiful day. Since we're together. The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost. the Minnow would be lost. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be? Believe it or not its just me. So this is the tale of our castaways they're here for a long long time. They'll have to make the best of things its an uphill climb.
